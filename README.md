libSplash - Simple Parallel file output Library for Accumulating Simulation data using Hdf5
===========================================================================================

Introduction
------------

**libSplash** aims at developing a HDF5-based
I/O library for HPC simulations. It is created as an easy-to-use frontend for the
standard HDF5 library with support for MPI processes in a cluster environment.
While the standard HDF5 library provides detailed low-level control, libSplash
simplifies tasks commonly found in large-scale HPC simulations, such as iter-
ative computations and MPI distributed processes.


libSplash is developed and maintained by the
**Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing**
([ZIH](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/zentrale_einrichtungen/zih)) of the
Technical University Dresden ([TUD](http://www.tu-dresden.de))
in close collaboration with the
**[Junior Group Computational Radiation Physics](http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=132&pOid=30354)**
at the [Institute for Radiation Physics](http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=132)
at [HZDR](http://www.hzdr.de/)
We are a member of the [Dresden CUDA Center of Excellence](http://ccoe-dresden.de/) that
cooperates on a broad range of scientific CUDA applications, workshops and
teaching efforts.
libSplash is actively used in the **PIConGPU** project for large-scale GPU-based particle-in-cell
simulations [picongpu.hzdr.de](http://picongpu.hzdr.de).
